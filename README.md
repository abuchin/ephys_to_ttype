# From ephys features to t-types


## Description

This notebook contains the data preprocessing code to analyze the ephys features of neurons. To find the match between ephys types and transcriptomics, we use various classifiers and compare the performance results between them. These classifiers include neural networks, random forest, SVM with ensemble learning.
